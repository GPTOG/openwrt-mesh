Scripts to support my Wifi-Mesh videos on https://youtube.com/onemarcfifty

make_dumb_ap:    turns a factory-setting OpenWrt router into a dumb Access point
make_mesh_point: adds mesh functionality, Mesh network and Wifi network

1. SSH into your router
2. run make_dumb_ap.sh
3. the router reboots - find the new IP and log into ssh again
4. run make_mesh_point.ssh

You now have an access point with mesh!

Enjoy.
